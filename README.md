# Art Store - HTML and CSS

This repository contains my project creating two HTML web pages (`pageOne.html` and `pageTwo.html`) along with an external CSS file (`styles.css`).

## Folder Structure

- `assign1_username/`
  - `pageOne.html`
  - `pageTwo.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - Images folder (if applicable)

## Instructions

1. Open `pageOne.html` to view the side-by-side layout with a background image.

2. Access `pageTwo.html` to interact with the form, featuring HTML5 built-in validation rules.

3. The external styling is managed by `styles.css`.

## Important Notes

- The form on `pageTwo.html` submits data to `http://faculty.washington.edu/ealmasri/assign1.php`.
- Dummy links are used with the destination URL set to `#`.
